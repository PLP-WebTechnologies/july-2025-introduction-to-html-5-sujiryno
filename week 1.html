            <p>Semantic HTML tags describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain. Instead of using a generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, we use tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. This clarity helps both search engines and assistive technologies, like screen readers, to better understand the structure and hierarchy of the page.</p>

            <h2 id="accessibility-heading">Prioritizing Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility is about creating a web that is usable by everyone, regardless of ability. By using semantic HTML correctly, we provide a robust structure that screen readers can interpret, allowing users to navigate and understand the content effectively. This includes providing clear heading hierarchies and using attributes like <code>aria-label</code> to offer additional context to assistive technologies.</p>

                <h3 id="heading-attributes">The Importance of Headings and Attributes</h3>
                <p>A logical heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc.) acts like an outline for a screen reader, enabling users to quickly jump between sections. Additionally, ARIA attributes can provide extra information to improve the user experience for those with disabilities.</p>

            <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results.
